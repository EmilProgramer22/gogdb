<h1>GOG Database</h1>

<div class="textbox shadow">
  <p>
    Welcome to the GOG Database, a third-party website that collects data on
    <a href="https://www.gog.com">GOG games</a>
    and tries to display it in a user-friendly manner. It's currently
    in beta state, because a lot of planned functionality is still missing.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get started visit the
    <a href="{{ url_for('product_list') }}">products site</a>
    and search for a game. Click on the name or ID to go to its info page.
    You can also install the <a href="/gogdb.user.js">userscript</a> to
    automatically add a GOG DB button to every store page.
  </p>
